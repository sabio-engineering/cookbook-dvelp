# The Why?
At DVELP, we are about loving what we do. We love to learn, we love to
experiment and we love to make the best products we can with the best tools we
can find. We’re brave, we work hard and at our core we are about quality.

We are building an environment where we can work hard and sleep easy, where we
can work remotely, but as part of a community, to deliver products globally.

Our colleagues feel reassured by being part of this initiative, that their hard
work is recognized, respected and rewarded.

Our team is distributed globally and encouraged to travel and engage with each
other on a professional and social level to help expand horizons and introduce
new perspectives.

We provide the best possible resources we can in order to help facilitate the
task in hand and optimize both efficiency and motivation at every level.

We want to be challenged, be encouraged to dare, to think openly and not be
restrained by corporate policy.

###We want to be better.
