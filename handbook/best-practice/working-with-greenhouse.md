# Working with Greenhouse

[Greenhouse.io](https://www.greenhouse.io/) is our Applicant Tracking System for
candidates to join our team.

## Shared Approach

Greenhouse is a great tool to coordinate the hiring process. However, in order
for us to be able to rely on it, we need to follow these rules:

**1. All candidates must go through Greenhouse**
  *  If you come across a candidate that is not yet in Greenhouse:
    * please create them on Greenhouse, uploading their CV if available
    * if the candidate came through a recruiter please ask the recruiter to
      upload the candidate to our Greenhouse portal, so that they are tracked as
the source of the candidate. If the recruiter does not yet have access to our
Greenhouse portal, please ask the [Greenhouse System
Admin](../readme.md#contacts) to set this up.

**2. All communication about a candidate must go through Greenhouse**
  * If we discuss candidates via email or Slack, the information is not
    available to the whole team and likely to be forgotton
  * Therefore, when emailing:
    * Send emails relating to a candidate from within Greenhouse (click the
      **Email Candidate** or **Email Team** button in the candidate's profile)
    * Always CC the recruiter, so that they are up to speed with latest
      developments, as well as <flyonthewall@ivy.greenhouse.io>, which makes
sure that any responses to your email are tracked in Greenhouse
    * When a recruiter and/or candidate emails you directly, reply from within
      Greenhouse
  * For shorter messages you can use @mentions in the **Make a Note** section on
    the candidate profile. This will result in an email notification to the
individual
  * If you have an offline conversation about a candidate, make sure the
    conclusions of this conversation are captured using the **Make a Note**
field

## Activity Feed

Every candidate has an Activity Feed. This is a timeline of all the
communications, notes and actions that have been tracked relating to the
candidate. If we have followed the above rules, we can rely on having 100% of
the context regarding the candidate. If we have not followed the rules, it is
likely there will be miscommunication and confusion that could have been
avoided.
