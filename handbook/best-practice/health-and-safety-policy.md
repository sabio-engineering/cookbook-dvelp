## Health and Safety Policy

We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of our staff and clients or anyone affected by our business activities and to providing a safe environment for all those attending our premises.

In particular we are committed to maintaining safe and healthy working conditions through control of the health and safety risks arising from our work activities, consulting with our staff and providing appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision and  taking steps to prevent accidents and cases of work-related ill health.

#### What is covered by this policy?

In accordance with our health and safety duties, we are responsible for:

1. assessing risks to health and safety and identifying ways to overcome them;
2. providing and maintaining a healthy and safe place to work and a safe means of entering and leaving our premises, including emergency procedures for use when needed;
3. providing information, instruction, training and supervision in safe working methods and procedures as well as working areas and equipment that are safe and without risks to health;
4. ensuring that equipment has all necessary safety devices installed, that equipment is properly maintained and that appropriate protective clothing is provided;
5. promoting co-operation between members of staff to ensure safe and healthy conditions and systems of work by discussion and effective joint consultation and the establishment of a safety committee, safety representatives and accident investigations where applicable;
6. regularly monitoring and reviewing the management of health and safety at work, making any necessary changes and bringing those to the attention of all staff.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for health and safety and the operation of this policy.  The Board of Directors has nominated the Managing Director as the Principal Health and Safety Officer with day-to-day responsibility for health and safety matters.

All staff must also recognise that everyone shares responsibility for achieving healthy and safe working conditions.  You must consider the health and safety implications of your acts and/or omissions and take reasonable care for your health and safety and that of others.

Any health and safety concerns should be reported to the Principal Health and Safety Officer.

#### Standards of workplace behaviour

You must co-operate with the Principal Health and Safety Officer, supervisors and managers on health and safety matters and comply with any health and safety instructions.

You must take reasonable care of your own health and safety and that of others by observing safety rules applicable to you and following instructions for the use of equipment (including safety equipment and protective clothing).

Any health and safety concern, however trivial it might seem, including any potential risk, hazard or malfunction of equipment, must be reported to the Principal Health and Safety Officer or your manager.

You must co-operate in the investigation of any accident or incident that has led, or which we consider might have led, to injury.

Failure to comply with health and safety rules and instructions or with the requirements of this policy may be treated as misconduct and dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

Information and consultation

We are committed to providing information, instruction and supervision on health and safety matters for all staff as well as consulting with them regarding arrangements for health and safety management.

#### Equipment

All staff must use equipment in accordance with operating instructions, instructions given by managers.  Any fault with, damage to or concern about any equipment or its use must immediately be reported to the Managing Director.

Employees must ensure that health and safety equipment is not interfered with and that any damage is immediately reported.

No member of staff should attempt to repair equipment unless trained and designated to do so. Failure to report damage to or a fault with equipment or failure to use it as directed may result in action under our Disciplinary Procedure.

#### Accidents and first aid

Any accident at work involving personal injury should be reported to the Principal Health and Safety Officer so that details can be recorded in the Accident Book.  All staff must cooperate with any resulting investigation.

Details of first aid facilities and trained first aiders are available from the Principal Health and Safety Officer.

If you suffer an accident at work you (or someone on your behalf) must report that fact to the Principal Health and Safety Officer or your manager as soon as possible.  All accidents should be reported, however trivial.  The accident will be recorded in our Accident Book.

#### National health alerts

In the event of an epidemic or pandemic alert we will organise our business operations and provide advice on steps to be taken by staff, in accordance with official guidance, to reduce the risk of infection at work as far as possible

It is important for the health and safety of all our staff that you comply with instructions issued in these circumstances. Failure to do so will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

#### Emergency evacuation and fire precautions

You should familiarise yourself with the instructions about what to do in the event of fire which are available from the Principal Health and Safety Officer.  You should also know where the fire extinguishers are, ensure that you are aware of your nearest fire exit and alternative ways of leaving the building in an emergency.

Fire wardens are responsible for the effective evacuation of designated areas.  In the event of a suspected fire or fire alarm you must follow their instructions.

Regular fire drills will be held to ensure that our fire procedures are effective and to ensure you are familiar with them.  These drills are important and must be taken seriously.

You should notify the Principal Health and Safety Officer or your manager as soon as possible if there is anything (for example, impaired mobility) that might impede your evacuation in the event of a fire.

If you discover a fire you should not attempt to tackle it unless you have been trained or feel competent to do so.  You should operate the nearest fire alarm and, if you have sufficient time, call the emergency services (999) and report the location of the fire.

On hearing the fire alarm you should remain calm and walking quickly, not running, evacuate the building immediately following the instructions of the fire wardens.  Do not stop to collect personal possessions and do not re-enter the building until you are told that it is safe to do so.

#### Risk assessments, DSE and manual handling

General workplace risk assessments are carried out when required or as reasonably requested by members of staff or management.  Managers are responsible for ensuring that any necessary risk assessments are undertaken and that recommended changes to the workplace and working practices are implemented.

If you use a computer for prolonged periods of time you can request a workstation assessment by contacting the Principal Health and Safety Officer or your manager.

#### No-smoking Policy

We are committed to protecting your health, safety and welfare and that of all those who work for us by providing a safe place of work and protecting all workers, service users, customers and visitors from exposure to smoke.

All of our workplaces (including our vehicles) are smoke-free and all staff and visitors have a right to a smoke-free environment.

This no-smoking policy complies with the Health Act 2006 and associated regulations.  We are committed to a programme of action to make this policy effective and to bring it to the attention of all staff.

#### Scope and implementation of the policy

Smoking is banned at our workplace.  The ban applies to anything that can be smoked and includes, but is not limited to, cigarettes, pipes (including water pipes such as shisha and hookah pipes), cigars and herbal cigarettes.

Staff may only smoke outside in designated areas during breaks.  When smoking outside, staff should ensure that they dispose of cigarette butts and other litter.

Staff using our vehicles, whether as a driver or passenger, must ensure the vehicles remain smoke-free.

We are committed to making this policy effective and to promoting a healthy working environment.  Workers who experience particular difficulty complying with this policy should discuss their situation with their manager.

#### Breaches of the policy

Breaches of this policy will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure and, in serious cases, may be treated as gross misconduct leading to summary dismissal.

Smoking in smoke-free premises or vehicles is also a criminal offence and may result in a fixed penalty fine and/or prosecution.
