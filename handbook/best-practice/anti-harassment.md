## Anti-harassment and Bullying Policy

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all staff are treated and treat others with dignity and respect, free from harassment and bullying.  All staff should take the time to ensure they understand what types of behaviour are unacceptable under this policy.

This policy covers harassment or bullying which occurs both in and out of the workplace, such as on business trips or at events or work-related social functions.  It covers bullying and harassment by staff and also by third parties such as customers, suppliers or visitors to our premises.

Staff must treat colleagues and others with dignity and respect, and should always consider whether their words or conduct could be offensive.  Even unintentional harassment or bullying is unacceptable.

We will take allegations of harassment or bullying seriously and address them promptly and confidentially where possible. Harassment or bullying by an employee will be treated as misconduct under our Disciplinary Procedure.  In some cases it may amount to gross misconduct leading to summary dismissal.

#### What is harassment?

Harassment is any unwanted physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating a person&#39;s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them.  A single incident can amount to harassment.

It also includes treating someone less favourably because they have submitted or refused to submit to such behaviour in the past.

Unlawful harassment may involve conduct of a sexual nature (sexual harassment), or it may be related to age, disability, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation.  Harassment is unacceptable even if it does not fall within any of these categories.

#### What is bullying?

Bullying is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour involving the misuse of power that can make a person feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated, undermined or threatened. Power does not always mean being in a position of authority, but can include both personal strength and the power to coerce through fear or intimidation.

**Initial steps**

If you are being bullied or harassed, you should initially consider raising the problem informally with the person responsible, if you feel able.  You should explain clearly to them that their behaviour is not welcome or makes you uncomfortable.  If this is too difficult or embarrassing, you should speak to the Board of Directors, who can provide confidential advice and assistance in resolving the issue formally or informally.
