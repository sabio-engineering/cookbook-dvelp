## Place of Work

**DVELP is a remote-first company**. As the default, we expect all of our team to
work remotely. We have a hub in London for those who wish to use it.

## Communication

As a remote-first team, communication is key to our day-to-day efficiency. We
primarily use Slack, with a channel per project, but also expect our team to be
responsive to email.

Communication helps **promote transparency, breakdown barriers and build trust**.
We encourage over communication at all times.

## Meetings

We aim to keep meetings to a minimum so it’s important we spend our time
together efficiently.

We run a weekly team stand-up at 10am on Mondays (London) and each project will
typically have their own daily stand-up.

Meetings give us the chance to share knowledge, understanding and our
objectives as a team working together. We expect people to be **punctual, prepared
and respectful of each others time**.

## Time Management

Our typical working day is 9am - 6pm (London).

We understand that efficient working hours may differ from one individual to the
next and we encourage flexibility. We must however respect the requirements of
those who we work with to ensure we are available when required.

For any extended time AFK (> 2 hours), we request that the relevant people are
notified 24hrs in advance.

## Deadlines & Overtime

We work on projects, which from time-to-time, will have hard deadlines.

Although we aim to prevent an increase in workload through careful planning, we
understand longer days are sometimes required to meet a deadline.

We don't operate an overtime remuneration structure, but we recommend that
people take time off in lieu to rest-up.

## Holidays

Time-off is extremely important to our well-being. We encourage our team to make
full use of their holiday allowance.

We track holiday days in Charlie HR and request that holidays are booked at
least 2 weeks in advance. We have a low-touch review process and aim to grant
all holidays requested.

We ask our team to use common sense when requesting holidays and be mindful of
any pressing project deadlines or pre-existing holiday arrangements.

**It is the responsibility of the individual to give sufficient notice to the
team they are working with (internal and external) of any time off.**

Holiday days are not carried from one calendar year to the next.

### Public Holidays

Our team work from many different countries, each with their own public
holidays. We request individuals follow the holidays set by their **country
of residence** and within the parameters of the individuals allowance.
