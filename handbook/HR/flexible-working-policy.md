## Flexible Working Policy

This flexible working policy gives eligible employees an opportunity to request a change to their working pattern.

This policy does not form part of any employee&#39;s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

#### Eligibility

To be eligible to make a flexible working request, you must:

1. be an employee;
2. have worked for us continuously for 26 weeks at the date your request is made;
3. not have made a flexible working request during the last 12 months (even if you withdrew that request).

#### What is a flexible working request?

A flexible working request under this policy means a request to do any or all of the following:

1. to reduce or vary your working hours;
2. to reduce or vary the days you work;

#### Meeting

We will arrange a meeting at a convenient time and place within 28 days of your request being submitted.  You may be accompanied at the meeting by a colleague of your choice.  They will be entitled to speak and confer privately with you, but may not answer questions on your behalf.

#### Decision
