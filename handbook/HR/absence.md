## Sickness Absence Policy

This policy sets out our procedures for reporting sickness absence and for the management of sickness absence in a fair and consistent way.

Sickness absence can vary from short intermittent periods of ill-health to a continuous period of long-term absence and have a number of different causes (for example, injuries, recurring conditions, or a serious illness requiring lengthy treatment).

We wish to ensure that the reasons for sickness absence are understood in each case and investigated where necessary.  In addition, where needed and reasonably practicable, measures will be taken to assist those who have been absent by reason of sickness to return to work.

We may vary the procedures set out in this policy, including any time limits, as appropriate in any case.

#### Disabilities

We are aware that sickness absence may result from a disability.  At each stage of the sickness absence meetings procedure, particular consideration will be given to whether there are reasonable adjustments that could be made to the requirements of a job or other aspects of working arrangements that will provide support at work and/or assist a return to work.

If you consider that you are affected by a disability or any medical condition which affects your ability to undertake your work, you should inform the Board of Directors.

#### Sickness absence reporting procedure

You should refer to your contract for details of our sickness absence reporting procedure.

If you do not have a sickness absence reporting procedure in your contract, you should follow the procedure set out below.

If you are taken ill or injured while at work you should report or be taken to the Board of Directors. Managers should make arrangements for anyone who is unwell to be accompanied home or to receive medical treatment where necessary.

If you cannot attend work because you are ill or injured you should normally telephone your manager as early as possible and no later than 30 minutes after the time when you are normally expected to start work. The following details should be provided:

1. the nature of your illness;
2. the expected length of your absence from work;
3. contact details;
4. any outstanding or urgent work that requires attention.
5. Managers should ensure that:
6. any sickness absence that is notified to them is recorded
7. Arrangements are made, where necessary, to cover work and to inform colleagues and clients (while maintaining confidentiality).

You should expect to be contacted during your absence by your manager will want to enquire after your health and be advised, if possible, as to your expected return date.

#### Evidence of incapacity

For sickness absence of up to seven calendar days you must complete a self-certification form, which is available from manager.

For absence of more than a week you must obtain a certificate from your doctor (a **&quot;Statement of Fitness for Work&quot;** ) stating that you are not fit for work and the reason(s) why.  This should be forwarded to manager as soon as possible.  If your absence continues, further medical certificates must be provided to cover the whole period of absence.

If your doctor provides a certificate stating that you &quot;may be fit for work&quot; you should inform manager immediately.  We will discuss with you any additional measures that may be needed to facilitate your return to work, taking account of your doctor&#39;s advice.  This may take place at a return to work interview (see Paragraph ).  If appropriate measures cannot be taken, you will remain on sick leave and we will set a date to review the situation.

Where we are concerned about the reason for absence, or the level of frequent short-term absence, we may require a medical certificate for each absence regardless of duration.  In such circumstances, we will cover any costs incurred in obtaining such medical certificates, for absences of a week or less, on production of a doctor&#39;s invoice.

#### Unauthorised absence

Cases of unauthorised absence will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

Absence that has not been notified according to the sickness absence reporting procedure will be treated as unauthorised absence.

If you do not report for work and have not telephoned manager to explain the reason for your absence, manager will try to contact you, by telephone and in writing if necessary. This should not be treated as a substitute for reporting sickness absence.

#### Sick pay

If you are absent from work you are entitled to:

1. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) provided the relevant requirements are satisfied. Qualifying days for SSP purposes are to Monday to Friday.
2. Company sick pay in accordance with this paragraph, provided that you comply with both the sickness absence reporting procedure set out in your contract and any requests made under this policy.  If you do not, we reserve the right to withhold payment of Company sick pay.

If a period of sickness absence is or appears to be occasioned by actionable negligence, nuisance or breach of any statutory duty on the part of a third party, in respect of which damages are or may be recoverable, you must immediately notify your manager of that fact and of any claim, compromise, settlement or judgment made or awarded in connection with it and all relevant particulars that we may reasonably require.  If we require you to do so, you must cooperate in any related legal proceedings and refund to us that part of any damages or compensation you recover that relates to lost earnings for the period of sickness absence as we may reasonably determine, less any costs you incurred in connection with the recovery of such damages or compensation, provided that the amount to be refunded to us shall not exceed the total amount we paid to you in respect of the period of sickness absence.

#### Keeping in contact during sickness absence

If you are absent on sick leave you should expect to be contacted from time to time by your manager in order to discuss your wellbeing, expected length of continued absence from work and any of your work that requires attention. Such contact is intended to provide reassurance and will be kept to a reasonable minimum.

If you have any concerns while absent on sick leave, whether about the reason for your absence or your ability to return to work, you should feel free to contact manager at any time.

#### Medical examinations

We may, at any time in operating this policy, ask you to consent to a medical examination by  a doctor nominated by us at our expense.

You will be asked to agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to us and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant doctor.

#### Return-to-work interviews

If you have been absent on sick leave for more than 14 days we will arrange for you to have a return-to-work interview your manager.

A return-to-work interview enables us to confirm the details of your absence. It also gives you the opportunity to raise any concerns or questions you may have, and to bring any relevant matters to our attention.

Where your doctor has provided a certificate stating that you &quot;may be fit for work&quot; we will usually hold a return-to-work interview to discuss any additional measures that may be needed to facilitate your return to work, taking account of your doctor&#39;s advice.

We are committed to helping employees return to work from long-term sickness absence.  As part of our sickness absence meetings procedure, we will, where appropriate and possible, support returns to work by:

1. obtaining medical advice;
2. making reasonable adjustments to the workplace, working practices and working hours;
3. considering redeployment; and/or
4. agreeing a return to work programme with everyone affected.

If you are unable to return to work in the longer term, we will consider whether you are entitled to any benefits under your contract and/or any insurance schemes we operate.
