## Personal details, home address and next of kin

The Board of Directors is responsible for maintaining up-to-date details of the home address, next of kin and emergency contact telephone numbers of each member of our staff.

This information will be requested by the Board of Directors when you start work and you should advise of any changes straight away.

It is important that we maintain accurate details in case a member of staff has an accident. Information is held in confidence and is only used when needed.
