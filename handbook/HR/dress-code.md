## Dress Code

We encourage everyone to maintain an appropriate standard of dress and personal appearance at work and to conduct her or himself in a professional manner.  The purpose of our dress code is to establish basic guidelines on appropriate clothing and appearance at our workplace, so that we:

1. promote a positive image and staff look professional;
2. respect religious, racial and gender-specific clothing requirements and those of staff with disabilities where possible;
3. take account of health and safety requirements; and
4. help staff decide what clothing it is appropriate to wear to work.

We expect staff to take a common sense approach to the dress code.
