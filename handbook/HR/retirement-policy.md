## Retirement Policy (no fixed retirement age)

We currently have no fixed retirement age although this will be reviewed from time to time by our Board of Directors to reflect our business needs.  We acknowledge that retirement is a matter of choice for individuals and will not pressurise staff into resigning because they have reached or are approaching a certain age.

Staff are free to retire whenever they choose or to seek alternative working patterns. For further information, see our Flexible Working Policy.

We are proud to employ people of all ages and consider that age diversity is beneficial to the organisation. We are committed to not discriminating against staff because of age and adhere to the principles set out in our Equal Opportunities Policy.

#### The purpose of the policy

This policy aims to create a framework for workplace discussions, enabling you to express your preferences and expectations with regard to retirement and enabling us to plan for our business.

#### Discussing your future plans

You or your manager may want to discuss your short, medium and long-term plans, as the need arises.  For example, a promotion opportunity may arise, or, if your circumstances change, you may want a different working pattern or to stop work altogether.  We need to plan for the business, and so may indicate to staff from time to time that it would be helpful to know what their plans are.  There is no obligation for us or you to hold workplace discussions about your future plans, but it may be mutually beneficial to do so.

We will not make generalised assumptions that performance will decline with age, whether due to competence or health issues.  If we think there are problems with your performance or ill-health, these will be dealt with in the usual way, through the Capability Procedure or Sickness Absence Policy.

If a workplace discussion takes place for the purposes described in Paragraph above, we will aim to make it as informal as possible.

#### During any workplace discussion:

1. we will not assume that you want to retire just because you are approaching a certain age, such as state pension age; and
2. we will not make discriminatory comments, suggesting that you should move on due to age.

If you indicate that you are thinking of retiring, you are free to change your mind at any time until you have actually given notice to terminate your employment.

Your employment or promotion prospects will not be prejudiced because you have expressed an interest in retiring or changing work patterns.

If you express an interest in moving to a more flexible working pattern or changing role, we will confirm that this is what you want before any action is taken which could affect your employment, such as a change to your role or responsibilities.

#### Giving notice of retirement

If you have decided to retire, we would appreciate as much notice as possible, although you should give the company at least the notice you are obliged to give under your contract of employment.
