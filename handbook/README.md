## Introduction

At DVELP, we are about loving what we do. We love to learn, we love to experiment and we love to make the best products we can with the best tools we can find. We&#39;re brave, we work hard and at our core we are about quality.

We are building an environment where we can work hard and sleep easy, where we can work remotely, but as part of a community, to deliver products globally.

We want to be challenged, be encouraged to &#39;dare&#39;, to think openly and not be restrained by corporate policy.  We want to be better.

We are an equal opportunities employer and do not discriminate on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, gender reassignment, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, disability or age.

## Using the Staff Handbook

This Staff Handbook sets out the main policies and procedures that you will need to be aware of while working with us. You should familiarise yourself with it and comply with it at all times. Any questions you may have with regard to its contents or what you have to do to comply with it should be referred to the Board of Directors.

The policies and procedures set out in this handbook apply to all employees.  They therefore apply to managers, officers, directors, employees, consultants, contractors, trainees, homeworkers, part-time and fixed-term employees, casual and agency staff and volunteers (collectively referred to as **&quot;staff&quot;** in this policy). They do **not** form part of the terms of your contract with us, which are provided to you separately.  Your contract sets out your job title, hours and place of work, probationary period, salary, holidays and holiday pay, sickness absence reporting procedure and sick pay, your entitlement to and obligation to give notice to terminate your contract and the duties of confidentiality and restrictions that continue to apply after the termination of your contract.

## Responsibility for the Staff Handbook

Our board of directors (the board) has overall responsibility for the operation of this Staff Handbook and for ensuring that its policies and procedures comply with our legal obligations.

The Staff Handbook will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors to ensure that its provisions continue to meet our legal obligations and reflect best practice.

All managers have a specific responsibility to operate in accordance with the provisions set out in this Staff Handbook, ensure that all staff understand the standards of behaviour expected of them and to take action when behaviour falls below those requirements.

Those working at a management level have a specific responsibility to set an appropriate standard of behaviour, to lead by example and to ensure that those they manage adhere to the policies and procedures and promote our aims and objectives with regard to equal opportunities.

Everyone should ensure that they take the time to read and understand the content of this handbook and act in accordance with its aims and objectives.  All staff must ensure that they are familiar with and comply with and support its policies and procedures.

Questions about the content or application of the handbook should be directed to the Board of Directors. In addition, staff are invited to submit any comments or proposals with regard to the handbook or any of its content to the Board of Directors.
