## Introduction

At DVELP, we are about loving what we do. We love to learn, we love to
experiment and we love to make the best products we can with the best tools we
can find. We&#39;re brave, we work hard and at our core we are about quality.

We are building an environment where we can work hard and sleep easy, where we
can work remotely, but as part of a community, to deliver products globally.

We want to be challenged, be encouraged to &#39;dare&#39;, to think openly and
not be restrained by corporate policy. We want to be better.

We are an equal opportunities employer and do not discriminate on the grounds of
gender, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, gender
reassignment, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or
belief, disability or age.

## Using the Staff Handbook

This Staff Handbook sets out the main policies and procedures that you will need
to be aware of while working with us. You should familiarise yourself with it
and comply with it at all times. Any questions you may have with regard to its
contents or what you have to do to comply with it should be referred to the
Board of Directors.

The policies and procedures set out in this handbook apply to all employees.
They therefore apply to managers, officers, directors, employees, consultants,
contractors, trainees, homeworkers, part-time and fixed-term employees, casual
and agency staff and volunteers (collectively referred to as
**&quot;staff&quot;** in this policy). They do **not** form part of the terms of
your contract with us, which are provided to you separately. Your contract sets
out your job title, hours and place of work, probationary period, salary,
holidays and holiday pay, sickness absence reporting procedure and sick pay,
your entitlement to and obligation to give notice to terminate your contract and
the duties of confidentiality and restrictions that continue to apply after the
termination of your contract.

## Responsibility for the Staff Handbook

Our board of directors (the board) has overall responsibility for the operation
of this Staff Handbook and for ensuring that its policies and procedures comply
with our legal obligations.

The Staff Handbook will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors to ensure
that its provisions continue to meet our legal obligations and reflect best
practice.

All managers have a specific responsibility to operate in accordance with the
provisions set out in this Staff Handbook, ensure that all staff understand the
standards of behaviour expected of them and to take action when behaviour falls
below those requirements.

Those working at a management level have a specific responsibility to set an
appropriate standard of behaviour, to lead by example and to ensure that those
they manage adhere to the policies and procedures and promote our aims and
objectives with regard to equal opportunities.

Everyone should ensure that they take the time to read and understand the
content of this handbook and act in accordance with its aims and objectives.
All staff must ensure that they are familiar with and comply with and support
its policies and procedures.

Questions about the content or application of the handbook should be directed to
the Board of Directors. In addition, staff are invited to submit any comments or
proposals with regard to the handbook or any of its content to the Board of
Directors.
