## Data Protection Policy

Everyone has rights with regard to how their personal information is handled.
During the course of our activities we will collect, store and process personal
information about our staff, and we recognise the need to treat it in an
appropriate and lawful manner.

The types of information that we may be required to handle include details of
current, past and prospective employees, suppliers, customers and others that we
communicate with.  The information, which may be held on paper or on a computer
or other media, is subject to certain legal safeguards specified in the Data
Protection Act 1998 (the **&quot;Act&quot;** ) and other regulations.  The Act
imposes restrictions on how we may use that information.

#### Status of the policy

This part of our handbook sets out our rules on data protection and the legal
conditions that must be satisfied in relation to the obtaining, handling,
processing, storage, transportation and destruction of personal information.

The [Data Protection Compliance Manager](../readme.md#contacts) is responsible
for ensuring compliance with the Act and with this part of our handbook. Any
questions or concerns about the operation of this part of our handbook should be
referred in the first instance to the [Data Protection Compliance
Manager](../readme.md#contacts).

If you consider that our provisions for complying with the Act have not been
followed in respect of personal data about yourself or others you should raise
the matter with your line manager or the [Data Protection Compliance
Manager](../readme.md#contacts).

#### Definition of data protection terms

**&quot;Data&quot;** is information which is stored electronically, on a
computer, or in certain paper-based filing systems.

**&quot;Data subjects&quot;** for the purpose of this policy include all living
individuals about whom we hold personal data.  A data subject need not be a UK
national or resident.  All data subjects have legal rights in relation to their
personal data.

**&quot;Personal data&quot;** means data relating to a living individual who can
be identified from that data (or from that data and other information in our
possession).  Personal data can be factual (such as a name, address or date of
birth) or it can be an opinion (such as a performance appraisal).

**&quot;Data controllers&quot;** are the people who or organisations that
determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is
processed.  They have a responsibility to establish practices and policies in
line with the Act.  We are the data controller of all personal data used in our
business.

**&quot;Data users&quot;** include employees whose work involves using personal
data.  Data users have a duty to protect the information they handle by
following our data protection and security policies at all times.

**&quot;Data processors&quot;** include any person who processes personal data
on behalf of a data controller.  Employees of data controllers are excluded from
this definition but it could include suppliers that handle personal data on our
behalf.

**&quot;Processing&quot;** is any activity that involves use of the data.  It
includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation
or set of operations on the data including organising, amending, retrieving,
using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it.  Processing also includes
transferring personal data to third parties.

**&quot;Sensitive personal data&quot;** includes information about a
person&#39;s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar
beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition or
sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any offence
committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the disposal of such
proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.  Sensitive
personal data can only be processed under strict conditions, and will usually
require the express consent of the person concerned.

#### Data protection principles

Anyone processing personal data must comply with the eight enforceable
principles of good practice.  These provide that personal data must be:

1. processed fairly and lawfully; 2. processed for limited purposes and in an
   appropriate way; 3. adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose; 4.
   accurate; 5. not kept longer than necessary for the purpose; 6. processed in
   line with data subjects&#39; rights; 7. secure; 8. not transferred to people
   or organisations situated in countries without adequate protection.

#### Fair and lawful processing

The Act is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data, but to
ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the
data subject.  The data subject must be told who the data controller is (in this
case DVELP Ltd), the purpose for which the data is to be processed by us, and
the identities of anyone to whom the data may be disclosed or transferred.

For personal data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have to be met.
These may include, among other things, requirements that the data subject has
consented to the processing, or that the processing is necessary for the
legitimate interest of the data controller or the party to whom the data is
disclosed.  When sensitive personal data is being processed, more than one
condition must be met.  In most cases the data subject&#39;s explicit consent to
the processing of such data will be required.

#### Processing for limited purposes

Personal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the
data subject when the data was first collected or for any other purposes
specifically permitted by the Act.  This means that personal data must not be
collected for one purpose and then used for another.  If it becomes necessary to
change the purpose for which the data is processed, the data subject must be
informed of the new purpose before any processing occurs.

#### Adequate, relevant and non-excessive processing

Personal data should only be collected to the extent that it is required for the
specific purpose notified to the data subject.  Any data that is not necessary
for that purpose should not be collected in the first place.

#### Accurate data

Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Information that is
incorrect or misleading is not accurate and steps should therefore be taken to
check the accuracy of any personal data at the point of collection and at
regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or out-of-date data should be
destroyed.

#### Timely processing

Personal data should not be kept longer than is necessary for the purpose.  This
means that data should be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no
longer required.

#### Processing in line with data subject&#39;s rights

Data must be processed in line with data subjects&#39; rights. Data subjects
have a right to:

1. request access to any data held about them by a data controller; 2. prevent
   the processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes; 3. ask to have
   inaccurate data amended; 4. prevent processing that is likely to cause damage
   or distress to themselves or anyone else.

#### Data security

We must ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against unlawful or
unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or
damage to, personal data. Data subjects may apply to the courts for compensation
if they have suffered damage from such a loss.

The Act requires us to put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the
security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of
destruction.  Personal data may only be transferred to a third-party data
processor if he agrees to comply with those procedures and policies, or if he
puts in place adequate measures himself.

Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the personal data, defined as follows:

1. **&quot;Confidentiality &quot;** means that only people who are authorised to
   use the data can access it; 2. **&quot;Integrity&quot;** means that personal
   data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is
   processed;
3. **&quot;Availability&quot;** means that authorised users should be able to
   access the data if they need it for authorised purposes. Personal data should
   therefore be stored on our central computer system instead of individual PCs.

Security procedures are described in our [Acceptable Use
Policy](./acceptable-use.md)

#### Dealing with subject access requests

A formal request from a data subject for information that we hold about them
must be made in writing.  A fee is payable by the data subject for provision of
this information.  Any member of staff who receives a written request should
forward it to the [Data Protection Compliance Manager](../readme.md#contacts)
immediately.

#### Providing information over the telephone

Any member of staff dealing with telephone enquiries should be careful about
disclosing any personal information held by us. In particular they should:

1. check the caller&#39;s identity to make sure that information is only given
   to a person who is entitled to it; 2. suggest that the caller put their
   request in writing if they are not sure about the caller&#39;s identity and
   where their identity cannot be checked; 3. refer to the [Data Protection
   Compliance Manager](../readme.md#contacts) for assistance in difficult
   situations. No-one should be bullied into disclosing personal information.

#### Data Retention

DVELP ensures that [sensitive information](./classification-of-information.md)
is not kept for longer than is necessary. Data relating to customers is only to
be retained for as long as a business justification remains.

At the end of a project engagement, [Project Managers](../hr/org-chart.md)
review any sensitive information held in relation to the project and destroy any
data that is no longer needed to fulfil our customer's requirements.
