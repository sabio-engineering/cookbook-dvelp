# Vulnerability Management

## Reporting of Incidents and Vulnerabilities

We encourage our workforce and customers to report any security related
incidents, vulnerabilities and questions to us at <security@dvelp.co.uk>. Any
report made to this email address is considered as an "Enquiry".

## Enquiry Tracking

We use this [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Hx0o5GpZ/security-reporting) to
track any incidents and vulnerabilities that have been reported to us. All
emails sent to <security@dvelp.co.uk> will be forwarded to this board and
processed there.

## Enquiry Processing

### Enquiry Evaluation

We evaluate enquiries within two working days of them being reported.

At Enquiry Evaluation the [Information Security Officer](../README.md#contacts):

1. Assigns the right person on the DVELP team to investigate the issue. This
   person is added to the Trello Card and henceforth responsible for the
   management of the enquiry. We call this person the Enquiry Owner.

2. Performs an urgency assessment and assigns one of the below urgency levels:
  * High (to be managed by Enquiry Owner as soon as possible)
  * Medium (to be managed by Enquiry Owner within 5 working days)
  * Low (to be managed by Enquiry Owner within 3 weeks)

### Enquiry Management

Once the Enquiry Owner takes on a task,
* He or she conducts the required research to understand the implications of the
  enquiry
* He or she will then implement a management plan that remedies any
  vulnerabilities
* He or she considers any communications required to our stakeholders to inform them of
  the incident, it's implications and our management plan

### Enquiry Review

Once the Management Plan has been implemented we will hold a review of the
incident and our response to it. This review includes:
* A retrospective on our performance in responding to the incident
* An assessment of any improvements that we should introduce in our processes in
  order to capitalise on the learnings from the incident
* A stress test to reassure the team that any vulnerabilities have been
  adequately remedied

The Enquiry Review will involve at a minimum the Enquiry Owner and the
[Information Security Officer](../README.md#contacts) but should be extended to
include all members of the team with expertise relevant to the incident.

### Information Security Incidents

At any point during the enquiry management process an enquiry can be identified
as an Information Security Incident, in which case the management of the enquiry
is escalated to the [Incident Response](incident-response.md) process.

Please see the [Incident Response](incident-response.md) policy for details
on how to identify an information security incident.

## Audit

Please see our [Internal Security Audit](internal-security-audit.md) plan for
details on the regular audit of this process.
