# Supplier Policy

In providing our services we rely on a number of third party suppliers that have
access to some of the sensitive information we handle. This policy sets out how
we vet our suppliers to ensure that they use appropriate measures to protect this sensitive data.

## Vetting Process 

We track all of our suppliers in our [Supplier
List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kog_nFut3v2t5mZNNatZ-oWb7tP3ImWdXjUP9EkZGc/edit?usp=sharing).

When we start working with a new supplier, we add the supplier to this list and
assess whether they will have access to [sensitive information](./classification-of-information.md). If so, they require vetting before this information can be shared.

If vetting is required we:

1. Review the supplier's information security policy (if available)
2. Add them to our [Upguard Security Monitoring account](https://cyber-risk.upguard.com/vendorlist).

Suppliers pass the supplier vetting process if one of the below is the case:

1. They are ISO27001 accredited
2. Their Upguard Cyber Risk Score is 700 points and above
3. We have a contract with the relevant employees of the supplier that requires them to comply with the DVELP information security policy

## Annual Review

We review our supplier's information security policy on an annual basis to ensure they continue to provide the required level of data protection.
