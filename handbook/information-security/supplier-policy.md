# Supplier Policy

In providing our services we rely on a number of third party suppliers that have
access to some of the sensitive information we handle. This policy sets out how
we vet our suppliers to ensure that we understand and assess the risks involved.

## Objectives

The objectives of our Supplier Policy are to:
* understand which of our suppliers are handling sensitive information on our
  behalf
* understand the risks created by our collaboration
* ensure the relevant suppliers follow best practices to minimise information
  security risks
* work with our suppliers to implement best practice where it is not being
  implemented
* make a conscious decision whether the risks we expose ourselves to are
  acceptable
* where we are exposed to unacceptable risk, mitigate this by ending the
  collaboration if necessary

## Vetting Process The below diagram illustrates the process that the rest of
this document describes in more detail.

### Supplier List

We define suppliers as any organisation that we collaborate with in providing
our clients with our services.

Our Supplier List tracks the suppliers we interact with. This is checked for
completeness monthly by the [Information Security
Officer](../README.md#contacts). As part of this check, we make sure all
entities that have ever invoiced us are on the Supplier List.

### Supplier Ownership

The [Information Security Officer](../README.md#contacts) will assign a Supplier
Owner to each Supplier in the Supplier List. These owners are tracked in the
Supplier List. They are responsible for conducting the Vetting Process laid out
below.

### Vetting Process

#### Vetting Requirement

We organise suppliers into four categories:

* Organisations without access to sensitive information.
  * These do not require a security vetting.
* Individuals and small organisations
  * These are likely to require an NDA to be signed and/or a negotiation around
    how to address vulnerabilities
* Medium-sized organisation
  * These are likely to require a review of their publicly available info sec
    policies, a questionnaire where necessary and negotiations to address
    vulnerabilities where necessary
* Large organisation
  * These are likely to require a review of their publicly available info sec
    policies. Given they are significantly larger than us, it is usually not
    feasible to require a questionnaire and/or negotiations. Therefore a
    decision to collaborate or not will be made based solely on the publicly
    available information.

The Supplier Owner decides whether supplier vetting is required for an
individual  supplier.

If a supplier vetting is required, this is to be completed within two months of
the supplier being added to the Supplier List.

The Supplier Questionnaire can be found
[here](https://goo.gl/forms/3J0BmcrOIhUxGP2x1) Responses to the Supplier
Questionnaire can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q4TB_HkJubEPoc4MjeColk0LG9AUr-6_2d_UvrnbY4g/edit?usp=sharing).

Our standard NDA can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_-nk5FLp-h5IycOM5Ntv0RxOcTWGWq7kfGZKqM8se4/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Vetting Assessment

In conducting the Vetting Assessment, the Supplier Owner assesses the available
information and answers the following questions:

1. Do we as an organisation sufficiently understand the risks of working with
this supplier?

2. Has the supplier adequately mitigated the risk of security incidents to
minimise the probability of them occurring?

3. Does the supplier's incident reporting policy allow us to effectively manage
such incidents if they do occur?

If the answer to all three questions is yes, the Supplier Owner accepts the
supplier.

#### Negotiating Mitigations

If the answer to any of the three Vetting Assessment questions is no, the
Supplier Owner may negotiate with the supplier to try to better mitigate the
risks.

Where such negotiations are entered, the final decision may be delayed by up to
two months. If at the end of these two months the three Vetting Assessment
questions can not confidently be answered with yes, the supplier needs to be
rejected.

#### Rejecting a Supplier

If a supplier has been rejected the commercial relationship should be ended
within two months of the decision to reject.

#### Accepting a Supplier

If a supplier has been accepted the commercial relationship can continue and a
review of the supplier's policies should be scheduled. This is tracked in the
[Supplier
List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kog_nFut3v2t5mZNNatZ-oWb7tP3ImWdXjUP9EkZGc/edit?usp=sharing).
