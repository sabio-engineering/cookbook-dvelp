# Internal Security Audit

Biannually, the [Internal Auditor (IA)](../README.md#contacts) will audit
company-wide adherence to the DVELP Information Security Policies. The dates for
2019-2020 are as follows:

* Monday 18th March 2019
* Wednesday 18th September 2019
* Wednesday 18th March 2020
* Friday 18th September 2020

During the audit, the IA will confirm process policies are followed and that
team members know where to find DVELP guidance for any potential scenario.
During an audit, the IA will cover a random selection of requirements from each
chapter of our [Information Security](../information-security/README.md) Policy and will challenge each team member on at least one requirement.

These internal audits and any nonconformities identified will be recorded in the
[Internal Audit
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGXHbE6v7jsyy1Qbd7m7i04oCfzN-_57SXP0yhu_UUc/edit#gid=0).

Internal audit records will be reported on at the management review meetings.
