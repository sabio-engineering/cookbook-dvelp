## Information and Communications Systems Policy

Our electronic communications systems and equipment are intended to promote effective communication and working practices within our organisation, and are critical to the success of our business.  This part of our handbook deals mainly with the use (and misuse) of computer equipment, e-mail, the internet, telephones, Blackberries, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and voicemail, but it applies equally to the use of fax machines, copiers, scanners, CCTV, and electronic key fobs and cards.  It outlines the standards we require users of these systems to observe, the circumstances in which we will monitor use of these systems and the action we will take in respect of breaches of these standards.

All staff are expected to protect our electronic communications systems and equipment from unauthorised access and harm at all times.  Failure to do so may be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure and, in serious cases, may be treated as gross misconduct leading to summary dismissal.

#### Equipment security and passwords

Staff are responsible for the security of the equipment allocated to or used by them, and must not allow it to be used by anyone other than as permitted by this handbook.

If given access to the e-mail system or to the Internet, staff are responsible for the security of their terminals. If leaving a terminal unattended or on leaving the office they should ensure that they lock their terminal or log off to prevent unauthorised users accessing the system in their absence. Staff without authorisation should only be allowed to use terminals under supervision.

Passwords are unique to each user and must be changed regularly to ensure confidentiality. Passwords must be kept confidential and encrypted and must not be made available to anyone else unless authorised by the Managing Director.  For the avoidance of doubt, on the termination of employment (for any reason) staff must provide details of their passwords to the Managing Director and return any equipment, key fobs or cards.

Staff who have been issued with a laptop, PDA or Blackberry must ensure that it is kept secure at all times, especially when travelling.  Passwords must be used to secure access to data kept on such equipment to ensure that confidential data is protected in the event of loss or theft. Staff should also be aware that when using equipment away from the workplace, documents may be read by third parties, for example, passengers on public transport. All data should be encrypted where possible.

#### Systems and data security

Staff should not delete, destroy or modify existing systems, programs, information or data, which could have the effect of harming our business or exposing it to risk.

Staff should not attempt to gain access to restricted areas of the network, or to any password-protected information, unless specifically authorised.

Staff using laptops or wi-fi enabled equipment must be particularly vigilant about its use outside the office and take any necessary precautions from time to time against importing viruses or compromising the security of the system.  The system contains information which is confidential to our business and/or which is subject to data protection legislation.  Such information must be treated with extreme care and in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.

#### E-mail etiquette and content

E-mail is a vital business tool, but an informal means of communication, and should be used with great care and discipline.  Staff should always consider if e-mail is the appropriate means for a particular communication and correspondence sent by e-mail should be written as professionally as a letter or fax. Messages should be concise and directed only to relevant individuals. Our standard disclaimer should always be included.

Staff should not send abusive, obscene, discriminatory, racist, harassing, derogatory or defamatory e-mails.  Anyone who feels that they have been harassed or bullied, or are offended by material received from a colleague via e-mail should inform their manager

Staff should take care with the content of e-mail messages, as incorrect or improper statements can give rise to claims for discrimination, harassment, defamation, breach of confidentiality or breach of contract.  Staff should assume that e-mail messages may be read by others and not include anything which would offend or embarrass any reader, or themselves, if it found its way into the public domain.

E-mail messages may be disclosed in legal proceedings in the same way as paper documents.  Deletion from a user&#39;s inbox or archives does not mean that an e-mail cannot be recovered for the purposes of disclosure.  All e-mail messages should be treated as potentially retrievable, either from the main server or using specialist software.

In general, staff should not:

1. send or forward private e-mails at work which they would not want a third party to read;
2. send or forward chain mail, junk mail, or gossip;
3. contribute to system congestion by sending trivial messages or unnecessarily copying or forwarding e-mails to those who do not have a real need to receive them;
4. agree to terms, enter into contractual commitments or make representations by e-mail unless appropriate authority has been obtained.  A name typed at the end of an e-mail is a signature in the same way as a name written at the end of a letter;
5. download or e-mail text, music and other content on the internet subject to copyright protection, unless it is clear that the owner of such works allows this;
6. send messages from another worker&#39;s computer or under an assumed name unless specifically authorised; or
7. send confidential messages via e-mail or the internet, or by other means of external communication which are known not to be secure.

Staff who receive a wrongly-delivered e-mail should return it to the sender. If the e-mail contains confidential information or inappropriate material (as described above) it should not be disclosed or used in any way.

#### Use of the internet

When a website is visited, devices such as cookies, tags or web beacons may be employed to enable the site owner to identify and monitor visitors.  If the website is of a kind described in Paragraph , such a marker could be a source of embarrassment to the visitor and us, especially if inappropriate material has been accessed, downloaded, stored or forwarded from the website.  Such actions may also, in certain circumstances, amount to a criminal offence if, for example, the material is pornographic in nature.

Staff should therefore not access any web page or any files (whether documents, images or other) downloaded from the internet which could, in any way, be regarded as illegal, offensive, in bad taste or immoral.  While content may be legal in the UK, it may be in sufficient bad taste to fall within this prohibition. As a general rule, if any person (whether intended to view the page or not) might be offended by the contents of a page, or if the fact that our software has accessed the page or file might be a source of embarrassment if made public, then viewing it will be a breach of our Information and Communications Systems Policy.

#### Personal use of systems

We permit the incidental use of internet, e-mail and telephone systems to send personal e-mail, browse the internet and make personal telephone calls subject to certain conditions set out below.  Personal use is a privilege and not a right. It must be neither abused nor overused and we reserve the right to withdraw our permission at any time.

#### Monitoring of use of systems

Our systems enable us to monitor telephone, e-mail, voicemail, internet and other communications. Monitoring is only carried out to the extent permitted or as required by law and as necessary and justifiable for business purposes.

We reserve the right to retrieve the contents of messages or check searches which have been made on the internet for the following purposes (this list is not exhaustive):

1. to monitor whether the use of the e-mail system or the internet is legitimate;
2. to find lost messages or to retrieve messages lost due to computer failure;
3. to assist in the investigation of wrongful acts; or
4. to comply with any legal obligation.

#### Inappropriate use of equipment and systems

Misuse or excessive use or abuse of our telephone or e-mail system, or inappropriate use of the internet in breach of this policy will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.  Misuse of the internet can, in certain circumstances, constitute a criminal offence.  In particular, misuse of the e-mail system or inappropriate use of the internet by participating in online gambling or chain letters or by creating, viewing, accessing, transmitting or downloading any of the following material will amount to gross misconduct (this list is not exhaustive):

1. pornographic material (that is, writing, pictures, films and video clips of a sexually explicit or arousing nature);
2. offensive, obscene, or criminal material or material which is liable to cause embarrassment to us or to our clients;
3. a false and defamatory statement about any person or organisation;
4. material which is discriminatory, offensive, derogatory or may cause embarrassment to others;
5. confidential information about us or any of our staff or clients (which you do not have authority to access);
6. any other statement which is likely to create any liability (whether criminal or civil, and whether for you or us); or
7. material in breach of copyright.

Any such action will be treated very seriously and is likely to result in summary dismissal.

Where evidence of misuse is found we may undertake a more detailed investigation in accordance with our Disciplinary Procedure, involving the examination and disclosure of monitoring records to those nominated to undertake the investigation and any witnesses or managers involved in our Disciplinary Procedure.  If necessary such information may be handed to the police in connection with a criminal investigation.
