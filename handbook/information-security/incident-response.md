# Incident Management

All security incidents must be managed in an efficient and time effective manner
to make sure that the impact of an incident is contained and the consequences
for DVELP and our customers are limited. This document sets out the DVELP plan
for managing security incidents.

## What is a Security Incident?

A Security Incident means any incident that impacts our communications or
information processing systems. An incident may be any event or set of
circumstances that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of
sensitive information.

An ‘Account Data Compromise’ is a security incident specific to payment card
data. It is an event that results in unauthorised access to or exposure of
payment card data (cardholder data or sensitive authentication data).  If an
unauthorised person obtains payment card data from your business, they can use
this data to commit fraud.

## How to Recognise a Security Incident

Staff need to look out for any indications that a security incident has occurred
or may be in progress, some of which are outlined below:

* Monitor excessive or unusual log-in and system activity, in particular from
  any inactive user IDs (user accounts).
* Watch out for excessive or unusual remote access activity into your business.
  This could be relating to DVELP staff or third party providers.
* The occurrence of any new wireless (Wi-Fi) networks visible or accessible from
  the environment.
* The presence of or unusual activity in relation to malware (malicious
  software), suspicious files, or new/unapproved executables and programs. This
  could be on DVELP networks or systems and includes web-facing systems.
* Hardware or software key-loggers found connected to or installed on systems.
* Suspicious or unusual activity on, or behaviour of, Web-facing systems.
* Lost, stolen, or misplaced merchant copy receipts or any other records that
  display the full payment card number or card security code (the 3- or 4-digit
  number printed on the card).
* Lost, stolen, or misplaced computers, laptops, hard drives, or other media
  devices that contain payment card data or other sensitive data.

## Incident Management Process

The below process should be followed once a Security Incident has been
identified.

### Reporting Security Incidents

Security Incidents should be reported as per the [Vulnerability Management
Policy](vulnerability-management.md).

### Investigate

After being notified of a security incident, the [Information Security
Officer](../README.md#contacts) will perform an initial investigation and
determine the appropriate response so as to limit the exposure of sensitive
information and mitigate the risks associated with the incident.

### Make sure that no-one can access or alter compromised systems.

Isolate compromised systems from the network and unplug any network cables –
without turning the systems off.  If using a wireless network, change the SSID
(Service Set Identifier) on the wireless access point and other systems that may
be using this wireless network (but not on any of the systems believed to be
compromised).  Preserve all logs and similar electronic evidence, e.g. logs from
your firewall, anti-virus tool, access control system, web server, application
server, database, etc.  Perform a backup of systems to preserve their current
state – this will also facilitate any subsequent investigations.  Keep a record
of all actions staff take.  Stay alert for further indications of compromise or
suspicious activity in the environment, or that of your third parties.  Seek
advice before you process any further transactions.  If you can, gather details
of all compromised or potentially compromised payment card numbers (the
‘accounts at risk’).

### Inform

Once the [Incident Management](incident-response.md) has carried out their
initial investigation of the security incident, the Communications/PR will
inform all relevant parties.

### Resolve

The [Incident Management](incident-response.md) will liaise with external
parties, including the ICO, law enforcement, etc., to ensure appropriate
incident investigation (which may include on-site forensic investigation) and
gathering of evidence, as is required.  The members of the [Incident
Management](incident-response.md) will take action to investigate and resolve
the problem to the satisfaction of all parties and stakeholders involved. This
will include confirmation that the required controls and security measures are
operational.  The Incident Response Lead will report the investigation findings
and resolution of the security incident to the appropriate parties and
stakeholders as is needed.

### Review

The [Incident Management](incident-response.md) will complete a post-incident
review after every security incident. The review will consider how the incident
occurred, what the root causes were and how well the incident was handled. This
will help to identify recommendations for better future responses and to avoid a
similar incident in the future.

## Reporting Data Breaches

In the case of a data breach, we need to contact the ICO to report the breach.
To do so, please follow the [ICO
guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/report-a-breach/personal-data-breach/)
on reporting.
