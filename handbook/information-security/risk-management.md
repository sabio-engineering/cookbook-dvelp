## Risk Management

### Risk Register

The company [Risk
Register](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gyK0zWSVlX-ZnXsN_c4-my86-hHjHEDY6IEP5h9UuVQ/edit?usp=sharing)
tracks all of the risks that members of the DVELP team have identified.

Where the anticipated impact of an unmitigated risk exceeds a rating of 4, the
management team will work together to find a mitigating action that reduces the
impact to below this threshold.

All members of the DVELP team are asked to contribute to the identification of
risks that we, as an organisation, face. Any newly identified risks can either
be emailed in to [security@dvelp.co.uk](mailto:security@dvelp.co.uk) or, if
you're a member of the DVELP team, directly added to our [Risk
Register](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gyK0zWSVlX-ZnXsN_c4-my86-hHjHEDY6IEP5h9UuVQ/edit?usp=sharing).
