# Information Security Charter

## 1. Introduction

DVELP is committed to delivering an Information Security framework, in line with
the ISO 27001 Information Security Standard, to improve the resiliency of
business processes and foster awareness across our distributed team and amongst
our customers.

DVELP engages with its parent group Sabio to maintain Information Security
standards across both parties, ensuring processes are appropriate and
followed.

Security is represented at the highest level within the company. Our CEO meets
regularly with the Information Security Management Team to discuss issues and
co-ordinate company wide initiatives.

The framework, approved by management, is designed as a functional tool, to be
referred to in the day-to-day, to improve awareness, define best practices and
crystalise key processes for prevention and resolution of information security
related issues.

DVELP is ISO27001 certified by the British Standards Institution. You can view our certification document [here](../../assets/ISO27001.pdf) and our certification status [here](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/certification/certificate-and-client-directory/search-results/?searchkey=licence%3d707439%26company%3dDVELP&licencenumber=IS%20707439).

use to deliver on our client's requirements.

## 3. Legal and Regulatory Context

DVELP will endeavour to comply with all legal and regulatory obligations and
constraints associated with information security, fraud and theft prevention and
detection.

DVELP will take reasonable and proportionate actions to facilitate and assist
law enforcement agencies (and other appropriately authorised investigators)
pursuant of their duties and responsibilities, and in this respect shall make
available in a timely manner all records, audit trails, system logs as may be

Additionally, DVELP has an obligation to some clients for Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance. DVELP has created a PCI DSS Charter
to manage this obligation.

## 4. Context of The Organisation

### Understanding the Organization and its Context

DVELP is a software consultancy, building solutions for clients in a number of
industries, including retail, health, and financial services. We are based from
a headquarters in London, and maintain a remote team that operates
internationally.

### Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties

DVELP’s management team has identified the following stakeholders as being key
to the design and maintenance of their information security management system:

- Company Board
- Contractors
- Financial Regulation Authority
- Information Commissioner's Office
- Our Clients (including end-users of the software solutions that are built by DVELP)
- Staff

These stakeholders trust us with sensitive and confidential information. They
need to know that we treat this information with the appropriate level of care
and have state of the art systems and processes in place to protect it from
unauthorised access, manipulation and duplication. Our Information Security
Management System sets out to provide this assurance.

## 5. Leadership

DVELP's Board of Directors and Management Team are committed to delivering a
robust Information Security Management System.

To that end, senior management has established the Information Security
Management Team. Our CEO attends the Information Security Management Meetings
and encourages the entire organisation to build security into it's DNA.

A full list of organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities is
captured in our [Contacts Table](../README.md#contacts).

## 6. Planning

Information Security risks and opportunities are reported to our
<security@dvelp.co.uk> email address and evaluated within 24 hours.

We assess risks in our business in line with our [Risk Management
Policy](risk-management.md) and take action to improve our systems in accordance
with our [Vulnerability Management Procedure](vulnerability-management.md).

Opportunities can also be identified internally by our developers by
adding them to the Backlog in our [Information Security Trello
Board](https://trello.com/b/Hx0o5GpZ/security-reporting).

### Information Security Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them

The objectives of our Information Security Management System include:

- Continuously improving our processes by acting on reported vulnerabilities
  within one month in all cases, as tracked by our [Information Security Trello
  Board](https://trello.com/b/Hx0o5GpZ/security-reporting)
- Continuously reducing risks by mitigating risks with significant potential
  impact as per our [Risk Management Policy](risk-management.md)
- Obtaining and maintaining ISO27001 accreditation

## 7. Support

### Resources

We commit resources to Information Security Management by:

- Maintaining Information Security Roles and responsibilities as laid out
  [here](../README.md#contacts).
- Holding regular Management Meetings with our [Information Security Management
  Team](../README.md#teams).
- Regularly conducting internal audits as per our [Internal Audit
  Policy](internal-security-audit.md)
- Monitoring our <security@dvelp.co.uk> inbox with a 24h response time

### Competence

We ensure that we remain aware of latest trends and developments and have the
competencies to protect against latest threads by attending a number of [Special
Interest Groups](special-interest-groups.md).

### Awareness

We ensure our staff are aware of our policies by:

- Ensuring new joiners read and understand our [Information Security
  Policy](README.md)
- Regularly [auditing our compliance internally](internal-security-audit.md)
- Regularly providing quizzes on our policies to all staff

### Communication and Documented Information

We communicate our policies and documentation via our [Information Security
GitHub page](README.md). This provides a medium our developers are familiar with
from their everyday workflow and it is public to everyone to see online.

## 8. Operation

### Operational Planning and Control

At our regular Information Security Management Meetings we assess our recent
performance against our security objectives and agree any controls that need to
be put in place to enable us to achieve our objectives.

### Information Security Risk Assessment and Treatment

Risks are assessed and treated in accordance with our [Risk
Management](risk-management.md) policy.

## 9. Performance Evaluation

### Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation

We measure the performance of our Information Security Management System in
three main ways:

- the number of unmitigated risks with significant impact in our [Risk
  Register](risk-management.md)
- the number of questions our staff answer incorrectly during our [Internal
  Security Audits](internal-security-audit.md)
- the average resolution time of enquiries submitted to <security@dvelp.co.uk>

### Internal Audit

[Internal Audits](internal-security-audit.md) are conducted on a regular basis
in order to ensure our staff are aware of our policies and enact them in their
day-to-day work. The results of these audits are tracked for continual
improvement as part of our regular Information Security Management Meetings.

### Management Review

The Information Security Management Team meet to review:

- reports to <security@dvelp.co.uk>
- the results of recent internal audits
- our internal policies and objectives relating to Information Security as per
  our [Information Security Management Meetings Policy](isms-meetings.md).

## 10. Improvement

### Nonconformity and Corrective Action

Any non-conformities with the ISO27001 standard that the Information Security
Management Team becomes aware of is given highest priority as part of our
[Vulnerability Management](vulnerability-management.md) procedure in order to
ensure we maintain ISO27001 compliance and accreditation.

### Continual Improvement

We are committed to continuously improving our processes and becoming more
secure over time. We ask our staff and customers to report any queries,
uncertainties, potential vulnerabilities and potential opportunities for
improvement to <security@dvelp.co.uk> so that we can take the appropriate steps
to remedy any shortfalls and implement any improvements in line with our
[Vulnerability Management](vulnerability-management.md).

## 11. Violations

All violations of this Charter will be reviewed and discussed by the Information
Security Officer and the Executive Team. Any violation may result in formal
[disciplinary action](/handbook/hr/disciplinary-procedure.md).

In the event the violation is in breach of any legal or regulatory obligations,
DVELP may take legal action against the individual or organisation concerned.
