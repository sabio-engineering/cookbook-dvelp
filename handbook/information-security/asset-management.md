#Asset Management

## Device Log

During onboarding, new hires are required to register their any device used for
DVELP business on the [Device
Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV6c4mM0YExWZbqztMBWbKUqNlQjDYSBWLHTuvpn3ls/edit#gid=90742438).
Any devices acquired after this period must also be recorded in the same way.

If your device is lost or stolen, you must notify the Information Security
Officer (ISO) without delay. You must change all passwords for your DVELP
accounts. If it is possible to remotely wipe your device, you must do so. If you
find evidence of unauthorised access to an account, inform the ISO.

If you wish to retire a device, you must make sure you’ve logged out of all
DVELP accounts and then completely wipe the device before disposing of it.

## BYOD Policy

You may use your own device for work. This includes desktop computers, laptops,
tablets and smartphones. DVELP require that if you are using your own device, it
is encrypted and secured by a password or a biometric access control.

If you are not able to adhere to this requirement, or you simply don’t want to
use your own device, DVELP will supply you with a company-owned device if it is
needed for your role.
