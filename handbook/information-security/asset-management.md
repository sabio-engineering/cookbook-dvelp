## Device Policy

Devices covered by this policy include desktop computers, laptops, tablets and
smartphones used to perform tasks on behalf of DVELP. They may be owned by the
business or the individual. All devices must be encrypted and secured by a
password or a biometric access control. All devices must be registered on the
[Device
Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV6c4mM0YExWZbqztMBWbKUqNlQjDYSBWLHTuvpn3ls/edit#gid=90742438).

### BYOD Policy

You may use your own device for work. This includes desktop computers, laptops,
tablets and smartphones.

### Register of Devices

All devices used for DVELP businesses must be registered on the [Device
Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV6c4mM0YExWZbqztMBWbKUqNlQjDYSBWLHTuvpn3ls/edit#gid=90742438).

This forms a part of the onboarding process and must also be completed if
further devices are acquired at a later date.

On the Device Register, you are required to supply:

* Device type (desktop computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone)
* Manufacturer
* Model
* Serial number
* Confirmation of encryption

### Loss of Devices

If your device is lost or stolen, you must report it to <security@dvelp.co.uk>
without delay. You must change all passwords for your DVELP accounts. If it is
possible to remotely wipe your device, you must do so. If you find evidence of
unauthorised access to an account, report it to <security@dvelp.co.uk>.

### Removal of Devices

If you wish to retire a device, you must make sure youâ€™ve logged out of all
DVELP accounts and then completely wipe the device before disposing of it. You
must notify <security@dvelp.co.uk> that this has been done.

When the production and security teams receive an email sent to
<security@dvelp.co.uk> it will be handled within 24h.

## Return of DVELP-Owned Assets

All DVELP-owned computing resources must be returned upon separation from the
company. Details will be defined in the [off-boarding
checklist](../hr/off-boarding.md) in Charlie HR.
