# Physical and environmental security

## Secure areas

### Physical security perimeter

There are two security perimeters that affect our operations: 1. Our London
office 2. The locations of the Amazon Web Services data centres that run our
remote servers

### Physical entry controls

Our London office requires the use of swipe cards in order to access the
building, our floor and our corridor. More information is available
[here](https://help.wework.com/hc/en-us/articles/212962043-What-security-measures-does-WeWork-have-in-place-to-protect-members-and-their-property)

### Securing offices, rooms and facilities

However, our office room itself does not have swipe card access. Instead each
member of the team carries a key to the lock on the door. It is our policy to
never leave the room unlocked if there is not at least one other team member in
the room.

In case of any office related emergencies, the WeWork emergency hotline can be
found

### Working in secure areas

Secure areas for us are:
* Our employees' homes
* Our London office

Whenever we are not in one of these secure areas we must:
* respect the [off-premesis](#security-of-equipment-and-assets-off-premises)
  policy.

## Equipment

### Security of equipment and assets off-premises

We often work in public places. This because:
* some members of our team work remotely from shared office spaces
* we travel regularly to meet our clients and can work in transit

In order to avoid any security breaches:
* we never show and/or type passwords and access keys when others can see our
  screen
* we never leave our devices unattended in public places
