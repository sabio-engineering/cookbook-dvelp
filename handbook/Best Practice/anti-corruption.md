## Anti-corruption and Bribery Policy

It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner.  We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate and implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.

We will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.  However, we remain bound by the laws of the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, in respect of our conduct both at home and abroad.

#### The purpose of this policy is to:

1. set out our responsibilities, and of those working for us, in observing and upholding our position on bribery and corruption; and
2. provide information and guidance to those working for us on how to recognise and deal with bribery and corruption issues.

It is a criminal offence to offer, promise, give, request, or accept a bribe.  Individuals found guilty can be punished by up to ten years&#39; imprisonment and/or a fine.  As an employer if we fail to prevent bribery we can face an unlimited fine, exclusion from tendering for public contracts, and damage to our reputation. We therefore take our legal responsibilities very seriously.

In this policy, **&quot;third party&quot;** means any individual or organisation you come into contact with during the course of your work for us, and includes actual and potential clients, customers, suppliers, distributors, business contacts, agents, advisers, and government and public bodies, including their advisors, representatives and officials, politicians and political parties.

#### Who must comply with this policy?

This policy applies to all persons working for us or any Group Company or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners, sponsors, or any other person associated with us, wherever located (collectively referred to as **&quot;workers&quot;** in this policy).

#### What are bribery and corruption?

**&quot;Bribery&quot;** is offering, promising, giving or accepting any financial or other advantage, to induce the recipient or any other person to act improperly in the performance of their functions, or to reward them for acting improperly, or where the recipient would act improperly by accepting the advantage.

An **&quot;advantage&quot;** includes money, gifts, loans, fees, hospitality, services, discounts, the award of a contract or anything else of value.

A person acts **&quot;improperly&quot;** where they act illegally, unethically, or contrary to an expectation of good faith or impartiality, or where they abuse a position of trust.  The improper acts may be in relation to any business or professional activities, public functions, acts in the course of employment, or other activities by or on behalf of any organisation of any kind.

**&quot;Corruption&quot;** is the abuse of entrusted power or position for private gain.

#### What you must not do

It is not acceptable for you (or someone on your behalf) to:

1. give, promise to give, or offer, a payment, gift or hospitality with the expectation or hope that a business advantage will be received, or to reward a business advantage already given;
2. give or accept a gift or hospitality during any commercial negotiations or tender process, if this could be perceived as intended or likely to influence the outcome;
3. accept hospitality from a third party that is unduly lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.
4. accept a payment, gift or hospitality from a third party that you know or suspect is offered with the expectation that it we will provide a business advantage for them or anyone else in return;
5. offer or accept a gift to or from government officials or representatives, or politicians or political parties, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors.
6. threaten or retaliate against another worker who has refused to commit a bribery offence or who has raised concerns under this policy; or
7. engage in any activity that might lead to a breach of this policy.

#### What is not acceptable?

It is not acceptable for you (or someone on your behalf) to:

1. give, promise to give, or offer, a payment, gift or hospitality with the expectation or hope that a business advantage will be received, or to reward a business advantage already given;
2. give, promise to give, or offer, a payment, gift or hospitality to a government official, agent or representative to &quot;facilitate&quot; or expedite a routine procedure;
3. accept payment from a third party that you know or suspect is offered with the expectation that it will obtain a business advantage for them;
4. accept a gift or hospitality from a third party if you know or suspect that it is offered or provided with an expectation that a business advantage will be provided by us in return;
5. threaten or retaliate against another worker who has refused to commit a bribery offence or who has raised concerns under this policy; or
6. engage in any activity that might lead to a breach of this policy.

You must notify the Board of Directors as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future.  For example, if a client or potential client offers you something to gain a business advantage with us, or indicates to you that a gift or payment is required to secure their business.
