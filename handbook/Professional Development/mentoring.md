# Mentoring

At DVELP, we believe in `how` we do things. Although the end result is
ultimately what we strive for, the steps we take to get there are extremely
important.

The belief in our process and a continued desire to improve it helps us to be
more consistent as a team and more efficient in the day-to-day. It allows us to
spend more time above the value line.

As part of our commitment to this belief, we operate a mentor scheme to help new
team members get up to speed.

## What is expected of a mentor?

As a mentor to any new recruit, your overarching aim is to share the knowledge
you have, but importantly listen to new experiences and see how we can
improve collectively.

The following will help guide you:

- Spend time **pair programming** to work through your current project or task
  and share domain knowledge

- **Discuss the fundamentals** such as Git (FF merges), linting and project
  setup. The Cookbook is a great place to start

- Explain how to **efficiently manage time** to create a sustainable but
  productive working practice

- Walk through the quirks of our **remote-first culture**, the fascination with
  `afk` and the importance of fluid conversation regular updates

- Post a picture of some kittens to the `#random` channel

- Explain why we **obsess around the details** and how the small things, like
  consistent naming conventions of environments help prevent catastrophe

- Offer reassurance on **taking ownership for delivering code that works** and
  how to ship it to production with confidence

- **Review pull requests** and offer constructive advice on how to improve code
  where possible

- **Introduce existing team members** and share any key information about the
  day-to-day running of the project you're working on


## What can you expect as a mentee?

As a newcomer to the team, you should at a minimum, expect the following from
your assigned mentor and the wider team:

- A **warm welcome**, followed by a one-on-one video call with all existing team
  members

- An **on-boarding session** from your mentor to help you understand the
  ins-and-outs of how we do things, from development best practices (FF commits)
  to time tracking and booking holidays

- Support and advice writing your first few features and **shipping to
  production**

- A **point of contact** for any question, no matter how large or small

- Help setting up all the relevant accounts (GitHub, Harvest, Charlie, Google
  apps etc.)

- An **introduction to the project and team** that you will be working with

### Make Questions Multiple Choice

Asking questions is a fundamental part to learning. We have a nifty trick to get to your answer more quickly: make the question multiple choice.

By sending proposals along with your question, you will help the recipient to:

- Get up-to-speed with the context
- Show you have done research and are really stuck
- Allow them to choose, augment or add to the proposed solutions

A 'warm-up' question of 'hey, I'm working on this problem, have we solved it before?' is  always good place to start.

So remember, make sure the next time you ask a question, send some proposals too.

## How long should the mentorship last?

The mentorship is aimed to help people become confident members of the team.
The time required will change on a case-by-case basis, but we recommend that
mentors give close support for at least the **first 4 weeks**.
