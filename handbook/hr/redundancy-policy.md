## Redundancy Policy

It is our intention to manage our business in a manner, which results in secure employment for our employees.  We will always try to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies but sometimes these may be necessary.  The pattern or volume of our business or methods of working may change and requirements for employees may reduce.

#### The purpose of the policy

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that, whenever reduction in employee numbers may become necessary:

1. we communicate clearly with all affected employees and ensure that they are treated fairly;
2. we try to find ways of avoiding compulsory redundancies;
3. we consult with employees and with recognised trade unions **or** employee representatives; and
4. any selection for compulsory redundancy is undertaken fairly and reasonably.

#### Avoiding compulsory redundancies

Where we are proposing to make redundancies we will enter into consultation with all affected employees on an individual basis and, where appropriate, also with recognised trade unions _or_ employee representatives.

In the first instance we will consider steps that might, depending on the circumstances, be taken to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies. Examples of such steps include:

1. reviewing the use of agency staff, self-employed contractors and consultants;
2. restricting recruitment in affected categories of employee and in those areas into which affected employees might be redeployed;
3. reducing overtime in affected departments to that needed to meet contractual commitments or provide essential services;
4. freezing salaries for a specified period;
5. considering the introduction of short-time working, job-sharing or other flexible working arrangements, where these are practicable;
6. identifying suitable alternative work that might be offered to potentially redundant employees.
7. inviting applications for early retirement or voluntary redundancy.  In all cases the acceptance of a volunteer for redundancy will be a matter of our discretion and we reserve the right not to offer voluntary redundancy terms or to refuse an application where it is not in the interests of our business to do so.

Any measures adopted must not adversely affect our business and our ability to serve our customers.

#### Making compulsory redundancies

When it is not possible to avoid making compulsory redundancies, all affected employees and, where appropriate, recognised trade unions **or** employee representatives will be advised that compulsory redundancies cannot be avoided.  They will be consulted on the procedure that will then be followed and the criteria that will be applied.

The criteria used to select those employees who will potentially be made redundant will be objective, transparent and fair and based on the skills required to meet our existing and anticipated business needs.

Those employees who have been provisionally selected for redundancy will be consulted with individually.

Where selection for redundancy is confirmed, employees selected for redundancy will be given notice of termination of employment in accordance with their contracts and written confirmation of the payments that they will receive.

We will continue to look for alternative employment for redundant employees and inform them of any vacancies that we have until their termination dates.  The manner in which redundant employees will be invited to apply for and be interviewed for vacancies will be organised depending on the circumstances existing at the time.  Alternative employment may be offered subject to a trial period where appropriate.
