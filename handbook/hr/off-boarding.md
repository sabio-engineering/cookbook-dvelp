# Off-boarding

When an member of our team leaves we conduct we complete an off-boarding
process.

This process is defined in a CharlieHR checklist which can be found
[here](https://dvelp.charliehr.com/checklist_templates/4840).

It is the joint responsibility of the individual's Line Manager and the [HR
Manager](../README.md#contacts) to ensure the off-boarding
checklist is completed.
