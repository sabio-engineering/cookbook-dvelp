## Expenses Policy

### Reimbursement of expenses

We will reimburse expenses properly incurred in accordance with this policy.  Any attempt to claim expenses in breach of this policy may result in disciplinary action.

Expenses will only be reimbursed if they are:

1. approved by Ruby __before__ they are incurred;
2. claimed using the [Expenses Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/OxGsnYRT7UnaoP922);
3. submitted within 2 months of being incurred;
4. supported by relevant documents (for example, VAT receipts, tickets, and credit or debit card slips); and

Claims for authorised expenses submitted in accordance with this policy will be paid directly into your bank/building society account.

Any questions about the reimbursement of expenses should be put to your manager before you incur the relevant costs.

#### Travel expenses

We will reimburse the reasonable cost of necessary travel in connection with our business. The most economic means of travel should be chosen if practicable/possible and you should use existing travelcards and season tickets wherever possible. The following are not treated as travel in connection with our business:

1. travel between your home and usual place of work;
2. travel which is mainly for your own purposes; and
3. travel which, while undertaken on our behalf, is similar or equivalent to travel between your home and your usual place of work.

Please contact your manager regarding specific transport queries.

### Submitting  expenses
