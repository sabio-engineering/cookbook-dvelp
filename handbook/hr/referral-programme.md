# Referral Programme

We run a candidate referral program at DVELP. If you recommend a candidate for a role we
are looking to fill and that candidate gets hired and passes his/her probation
period, you will will receive an extra £500 in your next pay cheque. 

To manage this process, we are using Greenhouse.io, our Applicant Tracking
System:
1. Log into [Greenhouse.io](https://www.greenhouse.io/login)
2. Go to "All Jobs" to see the jobs for which you can submit candidates
3. Select a job
4. Go to "Candidates"
5. Click "+ Add Candidate"
6. Make sure you mark yourself as the "Source"

If the candidate is hired and passes his probation, the payment will be
triggered.

If you have any questions regarding this process, please get in touch with the
[HR Manager](../README.md#contacts).
