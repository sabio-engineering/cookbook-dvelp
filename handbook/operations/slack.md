# Slack at DVELP

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is our primary communication tool at DVELP, as it allows for great asynchronous communication and transparency with clients and each other.

## Installation

To use Slack, either download it or visit [http://dvelp.slack.com/](http://dvelp.slack.com/) - both have the same interface and the exact same features, it's just personal preference. If you use the web-version, please make sure you enable desktop notifications.

## Your Account

When you start at DVELP you should be furnished with a Slack account - an invite should be in your newly-minted @dvelp email address. If you don't have this, please [contact Ruby Williams](mailto:ruby@dvelp.co.uk).

Please enable 2FA if possible on your account for maximum security.

## Private Team Channel Usage

At DVELP we have a few things we do on Slack as we're a Remote-First company. The most important of these being the private #team channel - if you're not already invited to this when you join Slack, please request this from your Line Manager. In that channel you will see that people put:

- **Good morning** at the beginning of the day - let the team know that you're now at your machine, starting your work day
- **AFK <time period>** whenever leaving their desk (Away From Keyboard) - let the team know that you're not going to be able to immediately respond for however long
- **AFK Lunch** when going on lunch - same as above, but people generally assume that you'll be AFK an hour
- **Back** when you return from being AFK - let the team know you're back working again
- **Feeling unwell** if you're going to be off sick today - this is in addition to any communication with line/project managers that needs to happen as part of our [absence policy](/handbook/hr/absence.md)
- **Leaving on holiday** before you leave for an extended leave period - it's just nice to say goodbye to let people know you'll be out of reach for a while

These are all to inform other teammates of your status so you don't get pestered when you're on lunch or travelling for example. Occasionally other things will be posted in #team, but this is the majority of its usage.

## Channels

### General Public Channels

- [#general](https://app.slack.com/client/T051BGQ57/C051BGQ85) - The default Slack channel you cannot leave. Used for company-wide announcements or requests - please use @here/@channel _very_ sparingly!

- [#learning](https://app.slack.com/client/T051BGQ57/C0A928PT5) - Find some useful learning resource? Why not share!

### Prefixed Channels

To aid at-a-glance understanding of our many Slack channels, we have implemented prefixes for many of our use cases, which are detailed below. In all of these, if you feel like you require a new channel please consider if it should have one of these prefixes and do so.

_Please use `dash-case` when creating new Slack channels!_

#### Airline

For channels related to the [Airline product](https://dvelp.co.uk/products/airline).

- [#airline](https://app.slack.com/client/T051BGQ57/CA3KN4D17) - General airline chat

There are sub-channels (not listed here) which pertain to new developments on the product, or logging issues. Search Slack for `airline-` to see a full list.

#### Cust

For channels involving customer projects or comms. Customers/clients may be present in these channel (unless they contain `internal` in their name), so be aware of this when communicating in them.

Due to confidentiality, these channels are not listed here in the cookbook. Simply search Slack for `cust-`

#### Ext

For channels involving external groups (using Slack's shared channels functionality), we prefix them with `ext-` where we have control. In some cases (where the other party has set up the channel) we do not have this power, so not all external channels conform to this unfortunately.

Due to confidentiality, these channels are not listed here in the cookbook. Simply search Slack for `ext-`

- [#devs](https://app.slack.com/client/T051BGQ57/CMSE6LVPW) - All devs chat
