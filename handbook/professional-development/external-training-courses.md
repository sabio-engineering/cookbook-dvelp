# External Training Courses

We want everyone at DVELP to be able to progress their knowledge and understanding,
with as little barrier to that as possible.

The process for getting access to training materials should be as low as possible,
and aid you in your day-to-day life at DVELP.

## Getting Access

If you find an external training course/resource that you think would help you
progress professionally, we encourage you to make a proposal to your Line Manager
while setting your [personal goals](goal-reviews.md#personal-goals) each 3 months.

Please ensure you consider your commitments to projects and daily work you
already have. If you believe you need more time to complete the course, please
discuss this with your Project Manager(s).

Once agreed with your Line Manager that it's appropriate and will help you
achieve your goals, please contact James King with the details and cost of the
course. Once approved, you may purchase access to the course and submit an expense
using the [DVELP Expenses Platform](https://dvelp-expenses.firebaseapp.com/expenses).

_Note:_ Agreement with your Line Manager is not enough - you have to discuss it
with James King before purchasing access to ensure your expense claim will be
approved!

## Upon Completion

Once you attend a course that has been funded by DVELP, please let James King
know you have completed it. We would also like you to share what you've learned
with the team. This can be in any format you wish, for example you could:

- Do a presentation (Think out Loud)
- Create a blog post
- Hold a workshop

**This is not an optional element**, and you will be chased to do so upon course
completion. We all want to learn and become better.

## Mandatory Training

You may be asked to undertake mandatory training as part of your employment at
DVELP - such as attending certification courses/examinations to gain accreditations.
These follow the same process as courses you would like to attend.
