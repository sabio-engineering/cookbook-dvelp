# DVELP Careers

We're looking to expand our team of talented people, and want to be as open about the process and opportunities as possible - hence our having all our careers information on GitHub.

## Open Opportunities

We're currently looking to recruit the following roles:

- [Senior Fullstack Node Engineer](jobs/senior-fullstack-node-engineer.md)

## Hiring Process

### Apply

If you want to apply for any of the positions, please email [careers@dvelp.co.uk](mailto:careers@dvelp.co.uk) with your CV.

### Interviews

Once your application has been reviewed, there will then be a series of interviews to make sure we're the right fit for you, and vice versa. These are done one-at-a-time, with your progressing to the next if successful in the previous. We will try to keep these as close together as possible, and work with you to find appropriate times, be those in or out of working hours - we know it's not easy to get time off during the day for this!

- Short Telephone Chat (15mins)
- Culture Fit Video call (45mins)
- Technical Video call (45mins)
- _Engineers Only:_ Programming Session (Up to 4hours)
- CEO chat (45mins)

While this seems like a lot of interviews, we believe it's the most honest thing we can do - we want you to be comfortable and know everything about us through these interviews, and obviously we want to ensure you're the right fit for us too.
