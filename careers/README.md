# DVELP Careers

We're looking to expand our team of talented people, and want to be as open about the process and opportunities as possible - hence having all our careers information on GitHub.

## Open Opportunities

We're currently looking to recruit the following roles:

- [Fullstack Node Engineer](jobs/fullstack-node-engineer.md)
- [Senior Fullstack Node Engineer](jobs/senior-fullstack-node-engineer.md)
- [Product Manager](jobs/product-manager.md)

## Hiring Process

### Apply

If you want to apply for any of the positions, please check out [our careers pages](https://dvelp.co.uk/careers) - we can't wait to hear from you!

### Interviews

Once your application has been reviewed, there will be a series of interviews to make sure we're the right fit for you, and vice versa. These are done one-at-a-time, with you progressing to the next if successful in the previous. We will try to keep these as close together as possible, and work with you to find appropriate times, be those in or out of working hours - we know it's not easy to get time off during the day for this!

#### Short Telephone Chat (15mins)

This is just a quick chat to talk informally so you can get to know us a bit better, and we can get to know a little more about you. We'll also get most of the "boring" questions out the way here, such as notice period, current salary, location and what not. We'll be asking why you want to work with us, and what excites you about a possible career at DVELP.

#### Culture Fit Video call (45mins)

During the culture fit call, we want to learn all about what makes you tick, and how you like to work. We'll cover things like teamwork, leadership, and what do you do when things go wrong. If you've got things you're passionate about in terms of process, now's the time to let us know! We all grow when we share ideas, and we want to learn what your thoughts are.

#### Technical Video call (45mins)

By now we're getting to know each other well, so it's time to dive into the nitty-gritty of what you'll be doing on a day-to-day, and how you've achieved it previously - what you've learned, and what you'll apply here. As an example for engineers, expect questions around how you would design systems (don't worry, we're not expecting encyclopedic knowledge).

#### _Engineers Only:_ Programming Session (Up to 4hours)

Whiteboard interviews are rubbish, so there's no chance we'd do them here at DVELP. What we do instead is invite you to spend up to 4 hours with one of our own engineers solving a problem. You'll be on a video chat sharing your screen, and building a solution. Our engineer isn't just there to judge though - they're on hand to help you out and guide you along the right path. Don't worry if you have to Google something every 10 seconds, we all do that too!

We realise that trying to find 4 hours during your week can be hard, so we will try our best to accommodate you and can trim the time accordingly. We can run into outside office hours if needed. If the phone or doorbell rings or there's any interruptions, that's absolutely fine. We're used to working from home and all the distractions that can bring, so don't fret.

#### CEO chat (45mins)

We start with an informal chat, and we end with one. This is a chat with Tom about what you can bring to DVELP around whatever topics you wander into. There isn't much structure to this one - it's just so he can get a feel for where you'll fit in the company. Depending on your location, this may be in person or over video chat. This is a great time to ask questions about the whole business and our strategy - we want you to feel as excited to work here as we do already.

#### Done

While this seems like a lot of interviews, we believe it's the most honest thing we can do - we want you to be comfortable and know everything about us through spending time together, and obviously we want to ensure you're the right fit for us too.

### Post-Interview

After all stages we will be in contact as soon as we can with news on your progression to the next interview. We will always let you know either way - we don't keep people in the dark, waiting for emails or phone calls that never come.

If you've been successful all the way, then the next step is a background check. You can read more about what that entails on the [People Security](../handbook/information-security/people-security.md) page of our Cookbook.

We will then draw up a contract and get an offer letter through to you; we look forward to you starting with us!
