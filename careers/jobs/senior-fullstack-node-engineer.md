# Senior Fullstack Node Engineer

## About DVELP

DVELP is a remote-first, London based software development consultancy.

We work with leading brands like [Marks & Spencer](https://cloud.google.com/customers/marks-and-spencer), [British Airways](https://dvelp.co.uk/projects/britishairways), [Google](https://dvelp.co.uk/products/airline), and [Twilio](https://showcase.twilio.com/s/partner-listing/a8E1W00000097TDUAY) helping them to build secure, robust platforms for highly sensitive data.

Our experience ranges from designing and delivering end-to-end digital banking solutions, through to bespoke internal communication tools for the hospitality sector; however our powerhouse products and expertise are mainly around creating state-of-the-art realtime communications platforms across a plethora of industries.

At DVELP, we are about loving what we do. We love to learn, we love to experiment and we love to make the best products we can with the best tools we can find. We’re brave, we work hard and at our core we are about quality.

We are building an environment where we can work hard and sleep easy, where we can work remotely, but as part of a community, to deliver products globally.

We want to be challenged, be encouraged to 'dare', to think openly and not be restrained by corporate policy. We want to be better.

We have a strong engineering background, which remains at the centre of everything we do.

We are currently looking for an awesome Senior Full-stack Node Developer to join our team, initially to work with one of our large established London based clients. We are looking for like minded engineers, who are a master of their craft and with experience in leading a team.

At DVELP we believe in transparency, so all our business processes, information security, and coding principles are publicly accessible - to learn more about our approach check out [our cookbook](../../Readme.md).

### Tech Stack

We use a variety of technologies at DVELP, but we primarily have those that use Ruby on Rails, and those that use TypeScript/React/Redux and Express. All our solutions are hosted on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging everything from Kubernetes to Firebase. We use [Slack](../../handbook/operations/slack.md) for communications, as you can never have too many gifs. All our work is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DVELP), and built using [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/).

We could list absolutely everything we use, but we don't want you falling asleep. Let's talk and find out what you're passionate about, and if we don't already use it, we could end up incorporating it into our stack. We're led by our engineers, so technology may move fast, but we're never left behind - always pushing forward.

## Key Responsibilities of the Role

- Lead and advise on entire projects
- Be hands-on in new and existing code bases
- Working with the existing team to set and maintain standards of code quality and best practice across the organization
- Work closely with the product team to understand, scope and advise on the best approach to achieve a business objective
- Work with client’s engineering teams; leading, advising, and contributing to their solutions

## Day to Day Tasks

- Discuss and design new systems from the ground-up with strong opinions about software and design principles
- Develop new and maintain existing systems
- Write documentation to record and explain decisions around architecture and design
- Write unit integration tests as a first-class citizen
- Perform code reviews and participate actively in discussions, even around technologies you may not be an expert in

## About You

Please see our [Developer Proficiency](../../handbook/professional-development/developer-proficiency.md) for a full list of what we think makes a "Senior" developer, but some key call-outs are:

- Experienced and comfortable through the entire life-cycle of a feature, from ideation to delivery
- Can understand business drivers and make solid proposals for building new features or refining existing ones
- Are a subject matter expert in at least one programming environment

### Technical Skills

While we understand that good programmers can learn new skills, this role is ideally for someone who has good working knowledge and experience in the following:

- React
- Redux
- Typescript
- Node (Express)
- GraphQL

More generally, desirable but not required are:

- Experience with Twilio APIs
- Experience with Google AI APIs

We know there's a lot more to programming than what's listed above - but we'd rather learn through talking where your strengths are, than prescribe a pre-set list of hard requirements.

## Salary

We've chosen not to disclose the sort of salary we're looking to pay, because everyone is individual and we want to give everyone what we think is very fair compensation. We want to have that conversation with you to ensure everyone's happy, rather than sticking to a number on a page.

## Benefits

There are a wide array of perks available to you as a DVELP employee - everything from cheaper cinema tickets to discounted getaways, and loads in between. We're also open to having conversations around what you may need that's specific to you - don't be afraid to ask.

## Pension

Upon finishing probation you will be automatically enrolled in the government's Workplace Pension scheme.

## Location

DVELP is a remote-first company, so working from home or a co-working space is your day-to-day. DVELP (and its parent group Sabio) do have offices around the UK however, so working from those is more than possible too. DVELP has large clients all around Europe, so occasional travel to their offices may be required.

## Holidays

As DVELP is a multi-national company with employees all over Europe, you'll have complete flexibility over your holidays. We offer 22 days' paid holiday plus 8 usually reserved for public holidays - but we allow you to allocate all 30 yourself.
