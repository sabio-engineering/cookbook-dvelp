# Bug Classifications

Bugs happen, make sure you've setup the right diagnostic tools to catch them. Instructions for that can be found in the [Diagnostics](/guides/environments/diagnostics.md) section.

Once a bug has been reported it should be classified using the following definitions so we can decide how to prioritse them.


| Bug Classification | Definition |
|------------------- | -----------|
| P1 | The defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround. E.g. Payment cannot complete, item cannot be purchased, account cannot be created, complete failure of a feature.
| P2 | The defect affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not obvious and is difficult. E.g. A feature is not functional from one page but the task is doable if 10 complicated indirect steps are followed in a separate flow.
| P3 | The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround. E.g. A minor feature that is not functional in one page but the same task is easily doable from another page.
