## Kickoff Meeting

- Roles and responsibilities - introductions to the project team
- Overview - goals and success metrics
- Scope and deliverables
- Project management process
- Requirements and dependencies
- Timelines / Project Plan
- Risks (new technology, changing scope, unknown codebase etc.)
- Communications

## Discovery

- Often begins with a workshop with the customer or stakeholder
- Designers and engineers involved from the start
- Output will often be draft user stories, prototypes, story boards etc

## Backlog Preperation

- This will be a collaborative effort
- Recommended format for user stories:
  - As a… I want to… so that…
  - Acceptance criteria where needed
  - Relevant designs in the card
- All the information required to begin work on the card should be in place at the beginning of a Sprint

## Sprint Planning

- Sprints are typically 2 weeks in length
- Sprint planning will be where we discuss the stories and agree what we’ll work on in the next sprint
- Involvement of the whole team is essential - should last an hour
- Video call
- Only user stories that are ready to be worked on will be taken forward
- Opportunity to discuss implementation and design questions
- Estimate the size of each task
- Commit as a team to delivering a set of stories for the sprint

## Standups

- Run daily by designated Scrum master
- Video conference recommended
- Participants update on cards they’ve been assigned to and if they have any blockers
- Maximum standup length is 15 minutes. If further discussion is required it should be followed up in a separate call

## Backlog Grooming

- 1 or 2 times a week, 30 mins
- Product team creates cards
- Led by product manager
- Design and engineering team feed into cards

## Sprint Review

- Each sprint presented by the team to the client or internally
- Run through completed stories and highlight those that are not
- Demos for all completed stories (even back-end tasks)

## Retrospectives

- Reviewing previous retrospective actions
- What went well? What could be done better from the previous sprint?
- Agree measurable actions
- Assign responsibility
- Retrospective recorded in Retrospective Trello board and shared in Slack channel
- Flexible and varied
