# Maintenance, Support & Hosting

Ahead of [deploying a project to a live environment](/guides/project-process/go-live-checklist.md), 
it's important to agree and organise maintenance, support and hosting.

## Maintenance

Our maintenance agreements allow us to dedicate a set number of days to your
project each month. The dedicated hours are typically used for incremental
improvements, small features and general housekeeping. Maintenance contracts are
not analogous to [support](#support) and will not come with the same SLAs for
issue response time.

To make the most efficient use of allotted maintenance time, we recommend
planning the work as far ahead as possible, so our team can prepare.

Maintenance hours expire at the end of each month and cannot be carried over
from one month to the next. Hours cannot be brought forwards. Work that is
carried out over and above the allotted hours will be charged at a pre-agreed
hourly rate.

Maintenance contracts are paid up-front and the minimum contract length is 12
months.


## Support

Our support packages allow us to be on-hand to help resolve any unexpected,
unplanned issues that arise with your application.

Our support agreements come in the following packages.

|| Base | Plus | Enterprise |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Cost | £1000 | £2500 | £5000 |
| Email Support | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Telephone Support | Business day (8am-6pm) GMT | Business day (8am-6pm) GMT | 24/7 |
| *Response Times* | | | |
| [P1 - Business Critical](bug-classifications.md) | 5 business hours | 2 business hours | 1 hour |
| [P2 - Degraded Service](bug-classifications.md) | 8 business hours | 4 business hours | 2 hours |
| [P3 - General Issue](bug-classifications.md) | 10 business hours | 6 business hours | 5 business hours |

Support packages do not cover the professional services time & materials
required to resolve an issue. Professional services are charged per hour, at a
pre-agreed rate, with a 1 hour minimum call out charge.

Where possible, we will attempt to resolve any reported issue before engaging
an engineer.


Support contracts are paid up-front and the minimum contract length is 12
months.


## Hosting

We offer fully-managed, hosting packages. Packages come in the following plans
to suit the need of the project or application.

| Package | Detail | Cost (pcm) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Basic  | Single environment deployment (e.g. production only) | £180 per application |
| Pipeline  | Dual environment deployment (e.g. staging and production) | £250 per application |
| Pipeline Pro  | Triple environment deployment (e.g. development, staging and production) | £425 per application |

N.B. All packages include logging, through [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/) and error tracking, through [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).

We run our applications on Heroku and will pass on their [customer promise](https://www.heroku.com/policy/promise).
