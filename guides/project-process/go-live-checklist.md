## GO LIVE CHECKLIST

A Go Live Checklist should be added to every project trello board to ensure we all understand what has to be done before a project can go live.  

The card should be added at project kick off and be personalised for the project.
It should be reviewed at least once a sprint.


### Go Live Checklist

- Rollout Plan agreed with stakeholders
- Scoped requirements have been fully tested in staging (happy and unhappy paths)
- Error tracking setup (sentry) and being sent to the right places
- Required reporting setup and being monitored appropriately
- Handover documentation (technical and instructions for end users)
- Required training for users has been completed
- Rollback plans defined
- Security requirements are met (you should decide what these are the beginning of the project)
- Escalation process defined and shared with the client
- Plan for how future production releases are handled
