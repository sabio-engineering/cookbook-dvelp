# Git

Our quick guide to working collaboratively with Git and GitHub.


## Contributing to a Repo

* Create a feature branch
* Write good commits
* Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes
* Create a GitHub pull request to have your branch reviewed
* Merge into master
* Delete local and remote feature branches after merging


## Create a Feature

Create a new, local branch off `master`.

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b ${branch_name} # (* - check fusnote)
```

N.B. Branch names should be indicative of their function and be hyphenated e.g. `blog-comments`

## Commit

Make frequent, coherent commits that you will thank yourself for later.

```
git status
git add --all
git commit --verbose
```

Use the following template for writing a [good commit message]:

    Present-tense summary under 50 characters

    * More information about commit (under 72 characters).
    * More information about commit (under 72 characters).

N.B. Be sure to ignore files that contain sensitive data or that are specific to your local environment or workflow.


## Rebase upstream

Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes.

```
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```


## Request a Review

If you've created more than one commit, use interactive rebase to squash them into cohesive commits with good messages:

    git rebase -i origin/master


Share your branch.

    git push origin ${branch_name}

Create a [pull request] on Github and have a team mate review it for you. They
will make comments and ask questions via the web interface, or discuss it with you directly.

## Merge

Rebase your branch interactively to squash un-necessary commits like "Remove whitespace".

```
git fetch origin
git rebase -i origin/master
```

Force push your branch. This allows GitHub to automatically close your pull request and mark it as merged when your commit(s) are pushed to `origin/master`. It also makes it possible to [find the pull request] that brought in your changes.

```
git push -f
```

Double check your commits, scan the files you changed and merge in to master!

```
git log origin/master..${branch-name}
git diff --stat
git checkout master
git merge ${branch_name} --ff-only
git push
```

## Cleanup

Delete your remote feature branch.

```
git push origin --delete ${branch_name}
```

Delete your local feature branch.

```
git branch -d ${branch_name}
```


## Extra, Extra

Git is awesome and we use it alot, so get yourself some [good aliases] to help speed things up!

###### Note that you can set shell variables like this `branch_name=“newsletter-signup”`, and run most of the commands without having to change anything. Here's the list of variables needed:

```
branch_name=“”
repo_name=“”
```
