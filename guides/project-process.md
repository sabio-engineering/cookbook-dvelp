#Projects
We borrow heavily from the Agile method in our own unique approach to projects. 


##Project Principles

We have learnt that the best products are built when we work side-by-side with our clients, as a partner, in a collaborative and iterative manner. This proximity promotes trust and drives enthusiasm to build something awesome!

The `Big Reveal` at the end of a traditional waterfall project has proven time and again to be a set-up for trouble. If what the developer understood is different than what the client expected, it is expensive to change course after months of development. An iterative approach allows for feedback on a daily and weekly level; if we miss the mark on a sprint we only loose one week, not months. 

We trust our team to manage their own time within their sprints. This means they should be escalating to the team as soon as they see delays or unexpected challenges. Proactive communication ensures we can deliver support where needed and make the right decisions to keep the project on track.

To play their best, pro-athletes need to recover between games. We believe that our professionals need to recover between sprints. We work hard during the day, but strive to keep a sustainable pace and weekends work-free. That said, when the chips are down we pride ourselves on putting in the effort to get critical milestones across the line. 


##Project Processes

We start all projects with a collaborative discussion where we establish what success looks like and explore the challenges in getting there. We bring the technical team into this discussion so they are clear on the business goals of the project and can identify those challenges. 

We break-down the tasks into weekly sprints, ordered by priority. We aim to encapsulate specific feature sets in each sprint, so at the end we have something tangible that we can start testing/playing with. Work packages should be broken into small enough pieces to be completed in one day. This enables us to clearly see if scope is being completed in line with the sprint expectations. 

Sprints are both fluid and collaborative and are not enforced, arbitrary deadlines. Working in this manner ensures we attack the most relevant scope, which can change during the project. We understand and expect that the project scope may change during development and being flexible will allow us to build the best possible product. We log these scope changes and plan them into future sprints with the client according to priority and budget. We add value by not being 'Yes Men' and pushing back when we think new scope requests don't add value or could be prioritised differently. 

Longer term projects will employ regular high-level discussions to orient the team around the short and medium term goals. This will help to reduce ad-hoc development and allow us to give productive advice about implementation.

The projects we work on typically require multiple skill-sets, from designers through to back-end developers. We don’t operate with project managers in the traditional sense, but each project will have an advisor. The advisor is typically not ‘in the weeds’ and will check-in weekly to offer a fresh perspective and provide any advice where required. If there is a product manager they will provide the business scenarios, but the development team will determine how to best implement. We will have a senior developer on each project, who use their experience to act as solution architect and coach the rest of the team.

Day-to-day, the team working on the project are responsible for communicating with the client and making sure the work gets done. We start each day with a stand-up in Slack to get the team on the same page and help overcome challenges together.  

We request our clients join us on Slack and GitHub, so they can follow progress as it happens and be responsive to any questions. This is essential in shortening feedback loops and promoting iterative development. We don't maintain any parallel 'black-ops' back channels to exclude the client. A shared conversation between the client and our team is key to ensuring that the technical team understand the functional drivers for client scope requirements.

At the end of each project we run a retrospective to extract any relevant lessons, which are shared across DVELP to ensure we continuously learn from our mistakes and our successes.
