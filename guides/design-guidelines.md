##DVELP Design Guidelines

If you are a designer working with us on a project, there are a few simple guidelines you should follow to help things run smoothly. 

###Format

We prefer to receive design files in Photoshop's `.psd` format.

Iconography should be sent to us in `.ai`. If that isn't possible than please use the `.svg` format. 

###Laptop & Mobile

Designs should not exceed `1920-2000px` for the whole page and `1200-1400px` for the content to achieve good fit on laptops.

Mobile should scale down to fit in `320px` (iPhone 5). We recommend following this standard breakpoint grid:

```
Small: 320-639px
Medium: 640px
Large: 1024px
XLarge: 1200px
XXLarge: 1440px
```
###Image Optimisation

The most important thing, in a word, is **compression**. To reduce load times please use only as many pixels as are necessary. Images should be heavily optimised. JPEG is preferred to PNG.  

Check out Dan Barber's great [guide](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-complete-guide-to-optimising-web-images) to image optimisation for detailed best practice. 

###Design Guide

A simple [design style guide](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/50-meticulous-style-guides-every-startup-see-launching/) for the app is optional but useful. It makes our lives easier to have a guide with text elements and title standards defined for use across the whole app.


###Client Preview

We use [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) to show designs to clients. This means we need a `.jpg` version of anything requiring client sign-off. 

###Notes

If you hit a wall or have a question please drop us a line. While some projects have narrow briefs, we often have leeway for great ideas so don't be shy.
